** fewest requests in flight
** best latency from recent requests
some way to ensure backends not recently used still get traffic.  Gradually revert to mean if we haven't sent any traffic?
** response headers with load info
** separate endpoint with load info
Prometheus?  custom format?
** external metrics of load?
Query Prometheus directly?
* bounded queue of pending requests
** TODO count queued requests for internal use
can share this count with metrics or not
** TODO if too many requests are queued
* metrics
** TODO count upstream & downstream connections
** TODO count active requests
or started / finished
** TODO count queued requests
or arrived separately from started to backends
** TODO some measure of queue time
- record time entering queue
- histogram time in queue?
* configuration management
** TODO read config from env vars
** TODO validate config at startup
** TODO hot reload
